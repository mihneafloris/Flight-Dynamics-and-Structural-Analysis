Eigenvalues and eigenmotions:

eigenvalues from the measurements of generic data through numerical model
eigenvalues from the measurements of our data through numerical model
eigenvalues found analytically

eigenmotions plotted from the data itself from the generic data
eigenmotions plotted from the data itself from our data
eigenmotions plotted from the numerical model for generic data
eigenmotions plotted from the numerical model for our data

for everything using the numerical model, the model can be improved or not improved

things that improve the model:

Cm_alpha
Cm_delta
Cl-Cd
